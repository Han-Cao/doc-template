This is a *modified* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

Code block example:
``` python

def f() -> None:
    for i in range(1):
        print('Code block background color and font size are modified')
    
    return None

```
